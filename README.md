* This is the blog portal site for blog content lovers. Using the site, a user can read all blogs and, if they wish, write a new blog for the readers.
* Users can update their data only and cannot comment on their own written blogs.
* If a user wishes to add any favorite data, they can add those to the wishlist by clicking the wishlist button, and only the user can see their wishlist section.
* On the client side, React framework, MongoDB as a database, and Firebase authentication are used to authenticate users, and environment variables are used to securely restrict information.
* In the backend, Express.js is used, and JWT tokens are used to secure the Express API.
